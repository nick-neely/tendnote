# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with native child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: create one issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Destination, Notes, Decisions so far, Not yet specified, and Out of scope.
- **Child ticket**: create the ticket with `gh issue create --parent <map-number>` and one of `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`, `wayfinder:grilling`, or `wayfinder:task`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies. Resolve the blocker database id with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<blocker-number> --jq .id`, then add the edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<blocked-number>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`. The database id is not the issue number or node id.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children and keep only unassigned tickets whose `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` count is zero. The first child in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me` before doing any ticket work.
- **Resolve**: post the answer as a resolution comment, close the ticket, then append a one-line gist and named link to the map's Decisions-so-far section.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.
